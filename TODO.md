# Claif TODO List - MVP v1.x Focus

## ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Core Development

### Provider Package Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED






### Auto-Install Functionality (Issue #201) - ✅ COMPLETED






### Rich Dependencies Removal - ✅ COMPLETED




### Import & Architecture Fixes - ✅ COMPLETED




## High Priority - Phase 2: Quality & Stability

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Add comprehensive unit tests for all packages (80%+ coverage target)
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real CLI tools
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Tests**: Verify Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility
- [ ] **Mock Testing**: Create reliable mocks for subprocess calls
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for all repositories

### Error Handling & User Experience
- [ ] **Better Error Messages**: Make errors actionable with clear next steps
- [ ] **API Key Validation**: Improve missing API key error handling
- [ ] **Timeout Handling**: Add proper timeout management for long queries
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Handle subprocess failures and cleanup gracefully

### Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Complete documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] **Usage Guides**: Create comprehensive getting started guides
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Add common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Examples**: Add real-world usage examples for each provider

## Medium Priority - Phase 3: Release Preparation

### Packaging & Distribution
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Test `python -m build` for all packages
- [ ] **PyPI Publishing**: Set up automated PyPI release workflows
- [ ] **Version Coordination**: Sync version bumps across all packages
- [ ] **GitHub Releases**: Create release notes and changelogs

### CLI Standardization
- [ ] **Version Flags**: Add `--version` to all CLI commands
- [ ] **Help Consistency**: Standardize `--help` output across packages
- [ ] **Exit Codes**: Implement consistent exit code patterns
- [ ] **Verbosity Levels**: Standardize logging levels and verbose output

### Performance & Polish
- [ ] **Startup Time**: Optimize import time and CLI responsiveness
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Profile and optimize memory consumption
- [ ] **Subprocess Efficiency**: Optimize CLI tool communication
- [ ] **Config Caching**: Cache configuration loading where beneficial

## Low Priority - Future Enhancements (v1.2+)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Response caching with configurable TTL
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Session persistence and management
- [ ] Cost tracking and usage metrics
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Plugin system for custom providers
- [ ] Enhanced debugging and profiling tools
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Advanced configuration options

## Non-Goals for v1.x

These items are intentionally excluded from MVP plans:
- Web UI development (use existing MCP tools)
- Complex prompt engineering features
- Provider-specific advanced features beyond basic querying
- Database backends for persistence
- Multi-user authentication systems
- Advanced session management features

## Definition of Done for v1.1.0

### Quality Gates
- [ ] 80%+ unit test coverage across all packages
- [ ] All linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy) passes
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed and documented
- [ ] All packages build successfully with `python -m build`
- [ ] Auto-install functionality verified on clean systems
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

### Success Criteria
1. **Reliability**: `uvx claif query "test"` works immediately on any machine ✅
2. **Completeness**: All three AI providers (Claude, Gemini, Codex) functional ✅
3. **Auto-Install**: Graceful handling of missing CLI dependencies ✅
4. **Cross-Platform**: Verified working on Windows, macOS, Linux ✅
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-tested, documented codebase

## Current Focus

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Add comprehensive unit tests to all packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
3. Complete API documentation
4. Verify cross-platform compatibility
5. Prepare for PyPI publishing

The foundation is solid and working - now we focus on quality, testing, and professional release preparation.
