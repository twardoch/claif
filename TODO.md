# claif TODO List - v1.0 MVP Stability Focus

## CRITICAL (Blocking v1.0 Release)

### Core Framework Stability
- [ ] **Verify 80%+ test coverage** - Run full test suite and confirm accurate coverage reporting
- [ ] **Auto-install works consistently** - Provider installation succeeds in clean environments

## HIGH PRIORITY (Required for Stable Release)

### Cross-Platform Reliability
- [ ] **Test on Windows, macOS, Linux** - Verify all core functionality works across platforms
- [ ] **Path handling robustness** - Support spaces, Unicode characters, special paths
- [ ] **Python version compatibility** - Verify Python 3.8+ support
- [ ] **Subprocess execution** - Handle platform-specific differences

### Build & Installation Verification
- [ ] **Local build testing** - Verify `python -m build` works correctly
- [ ] **Installation from packages** - Test wheel and sdist installation
- [ ] **Dependency resolution** - Ensure all dependencies install properly
- [ ] **Package metadata validation** - Correct entry points, classifiers, etc.

### Basic CI/CD
- [ ] **GitHub Actions setup** - Automated testing on push/PR
- [ ] **Cross-platform test matrix** - Windows, macOS, Linux runners
- [ ] **Automated linting** - Ruff, formatting checks
- [ ] **Coverage reporting** - Track and enforce coverage standards

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Documentation Essentials
- [ ] **Installation guide** - Clear setup instructions for all platforms
- [ ] **Basic usage examples** - Core functionality demonstrations
- [ ] **Troubleshooting section** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **API documentation** - Complete docstrings for public interfaces

### Release Infrastructure
- [ ] **TestPyPI integration** - Test deployment process
- [ ] **Version coordination** - Manage dependencies between packages
- [ ] **Release automation** - Streamline PyPI publishing

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR v1.0

### Reliability (Must Have)
- ✅ **99%+ success rate** for basic provider operations
- ✅ **No resource leaks** in normal operation
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** with clear messages
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** across platforms

### Testing (Must Have)
- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** with verified accuracy
- ✅ **All critical paths tested** including error conditions
- ✅ **Mocked external dependencies** for reliable testing
- ✅ **CI pipeline passing** on all platforms

### User Experience (Should Have)
- ✅ **One-command installation** that works reliably
- ✅ **Clear error messages** for common problems
- ✅ **Basic documentation** for setup and usage
- ✅ **Fast startup time** (<2 seconds)

## NON-GOALS FOR v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Advanced configuration** options
- ❌ **Complex caching systems**
- ❌ **Multi-user support**
- ❌ **Database backends**
- ❌ **UI enhancements** beyond terminal output
- ❌ **Provider rotation** or failover logic
- ❌ **Session persistence** across runs

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **Cross-platform failures** → Use GitHub Actions matrix early
2. **Provider discovery bugs** → Comprehensive edge case testing

### Medium Risk Items  
1. **Documentation gaps** → Focus on installation and basic usage
2. **Build/install issues** → Test with fresh environments regularly

## DEFINITION OF DONE

For each task to be considered complete:

- [ ] **Implementation** meets requirements
- [ ] **Tests** cover the functionality (unit + integration)
- [ ] **Documentation** updated if needed
- [ ] **Error handling** includes clear messages
- [ ] **Cross-platform** compatibility verified
- [ ] **Code review** completed (self-review minimum)

## POST-v1.0 ROADMAP
