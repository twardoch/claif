# CLAIF Development Plan

## Overview

CLAIF (Command-Line Artificial Intelligence Framework) is a unified interface for interacting with multiple AI language model providers. This plan focuses on delivering a solid v1.0 that provides core functionality without overengineering.

## v1.0 Goals (Current Focus)

### Core Framework ✓
- [x] Unified provider interface
- [x] Plugin-based provider discovery
- [x] Fire-based CLI with rich output
- [x] Async Python API
- [x] Basic configuration management
- [x] Error handling hierarchy
- [x] Logging infrastructure

### Provider Support ✓
- [x] Provider abstraction layer
- [x] Claude provider wrapper
- [x] Gemini provider wrapper  
- [x] Codex provider wrapper
- [x] Parallel querying
- [x] Random provider selection

### Basic Features ✓
- [x] Simple query execution
- [x] Response streaming
- [x] Provider health checks
- [x] MCP server for tool integration
- [x] Configuration via files/env/CLI

### Documentation ✓
- [x] Comprehensive README
- [x] CHANGELOG maintenance
- [x] Code documentation
- [x] Usage examples

## Post-v1.0 Considerations

### v1.1 - Stability & Polish
- Comprehensive test suite
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- PyPI publication
- Bug fixes from v1.0 feedback
- Performance optimizations

### v1.2 - Enhanced Features
- Response caching implementation
- Session persistence
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting
- Cost tracking

### Future Possibilities (v2.0+)
- Web UI interface
- Advanced prompt templates
- Multi-turn conversations
- Provider-specific features
- Plugin system for extensions

## Design Principles

1. **Minimal Viable Product First**: Focus on core functionality that works reliably
2. **Provider Independence**: Maintain clean separation between framework and providers
3. **Simple Configuration**: Sensible defaults with optional customization
4. **Async-First**: Built for modern Python async/await patterns
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints for better developer experience

## Current Status

v1.0.1 released with:
- Core framework fully implemented
- All three provider wrappers ready (actual providers need separate packages)
- CLI and API functional
- Comprehensive documentation complete
- Loguru-based logging throughout

Immediate priorities:
1. Implement provider packages (claif_cla, claif_gem, claif_cod)
2. Test integration with real APIs
3. PyPI release of core framework
4. User feedback collection

## What's Actually Working

The core framework is complete but requires the provider packages to be functional:
- The `claif` package provides the unified interface
- Provider packages must implement the `query` async generator
- Plugin discovery works through Python entry points
- All infrastructure is ready for provider integration
