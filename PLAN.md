# claif Development Plan - v1.0 MVP Stability Focus

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Create a stable, reliable v1.0 core framework that serves as a solid foundation for provider packages.

**Current Status**: Working MVP with auto-install and basic testing infrastructure. Need to focus on stability and cross-platform reliability.

**Release Criteria**: 80%+ verified test coverage, reliable provider discovery, cross-platform compatibility, clear error handling.

## Critical Stability Phase (Blocking v1.0)

### Core Framework Hardening
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Fix pytest environment issues** - Resolve xdist/coverage conflicts completely
- [ ] **Verify 80%+ test coverage** - Run full test suite, confirm accurate coverage reporting  
- [x] **Validate error handling paths** - Ensure provider discovery handles all edge cases
- [x] **Test provider integration** - Verify actual provider package discovery and loading

**Success Criteria**: All tests pass reliably, coverage is accurate, error paths tested

### Essential Quality Gates
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Eliminate flaky tests** - No environment-dependent test failures
- [x] **Actionable error messages** - Users understand problems and solutions
- [ ] **Consistent auto-install** - Provider installation works in clean environments

**Success Criteria**: 99%+ test reliability, clear error messaging, robust auto-install

## Release Readiness Phase (Required for v1.0)

### Cross-Platform Reliability  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: HIGH

- **Multi-platform testing** - Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility verification
- **Path handling robustness** - Support spaces, Unicode, special characters
- **Python version compatibility** - Verify Python 3.8+ support
- **Subprocess execution** - Handle platform-specific differences

**Success Criteria**: Verified functionality on all major platforms

### Build & Installation Verification
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Priority**: HIGH

- **Local build testing** - `python -m build` works correctly
- **Package installation** - Test wheel and sdist installation 
- **Dependency resolution** - All dependencies install properly
- **Metadata validation** - Entry points, classifiers correct

**Success Criteria**: Reliable build and install process

### Basic CI/CD Infrastructure
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: HIGH

- **GitHub Actions setup** - Automated testing on push/PR
- **Cross-platform matrix** - Windows, macOS, Linux test runners
- **Automated linting** - Ruff, formatting checks
- **Coverage reporting** - Track and enforce coverage standards

**Success Criteria**: Automated testing pipeline working reliably

## Polish Phase (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Essential Documentation
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: MEDIUM

- **Installation guide** - Clear setup instructions for all platforms
- **Basic usage examples** - Core functionality demonstrations  
- **Troubleshooting section** - Common issues and solutions
- **API documentation** - Complete docstrings for public interfaces

**Success Criteria**: Users can install and use without confusion

### Release Infrastructure
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: MEDIUM

- **TestPyPI integration** - Test deployment process
- **Version coordination** - Manage dependencies between packages  
- **Release automation** - Streamline PyPI publishing

**Success Criteria**: Automated, reliable release process

```

### Stability Improvements Needed

- **Provider Discovery**: Handle edge cases, missing packages, version conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for network, permission, configuration issues
- **Testing**: Fix environment issues, achieve verified 80%+ coverage
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows path handling, subprocess differences

## Success Metrics for v1.0

### Reliability (Must Have)
- ✅ **99%+ success rate** for provider discovery and basic operations
- ✅ **No resource leaks** or hanging processes
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** with actionable messages
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** across all platforms

### Testing (Must Have)  
- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** with verified accuracy
- ✅ **All critical paths tested** including error conditions
- ✅ **Mocked dependencies** for reliable testing
- ✅ **CI pipeline** passing on all platforms

### User Experience (Should Have)
- ✅ **One-command installation** that works reliably
- ✅ **Clear error messages** for common problems  
- ✅ **Basic documentation** for setup and usage
- ✅ **Fast startup time** (<2 seconds)

## Resource Allocation

### Critical Path (80% of effort)
1. **Testing Infrastructure** (40%) - Fix pytest issues, verify coverage
2. **Cross-Platform Support** (25%) - Windows compatibility, path handling  
3. **Error Handling** (15%) - Clear messages, edge case handling

### Secondary Path (20% of effort)  
1. **CI/CD Setup** (10%) - GitHub Actions, automated testing
2. **Documentation** (10%) - Installation guides, basic usage

## Risk Management

### High Risk Issues
1. **pytest environment problems** → Could block entire release
   - **Mitigation**: Fix first, test in multiple clean environments
2. **Cross-platform failures** → Could limit adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Use GitHub Actions matrix early and often
3. **Provider discovery bugs** → Core functionality broken
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive edge case testing

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **Documentation gaps** → User confusion
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on installation and basic usage first
2. **Performance issues** → Poor user experience  
   - **Mitigation**: Profile critical paths, basic optimization

## Non-Goals for v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Advanced configuration** systems
- ❌ **Complex caching** mechanisms  
- ❌ **Provider rotation** or failover logic
- ❌ **Session management** across runs
- ❌ **Database backends** or persistence
- ❌ **Multi-user support**
- ❌ **UI enhancements** beyond terminal output

## Timeline & Milestones

**Total Estimated Time**: 4-6 weeks

- **Weeks 1-2**: Core stability (pytest fixes, testing, error handling)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Cross-platform support and CI/CD  
- **Weeks 5-6**: Documentation, polish, release preparation

**Release Target**: Mid Q1 2025
